Dataviz are manufactured products, are not "found in nature" -> they carry interpretations by the creator, so it's important to be aware of this

Now let's dissect the artefact...

:::

### <span class="pretitle">1. Data visualization as an artefact</span> The atomic level  {data-transition="slide-in fade-out"}

  <br />

Maximum data density is `1:1`, and this is not usually the case:

<table style="margin:2em auto;font-family:'Fira Mono';background-color:#eee;">
    <tr>
        <td style="border-bottom:0 solid white;text-align:right;padding:0 1em;">data points</td>
        <td rowspan="2" style="vertical-align:middle;border-bottom:0 solid white;">  &lt; </td>
        <td rowspan="2" style="vertical-align:middle;border-bottom:0 solid white;"> pixels</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="text-align:right;padding:0 1em;">observations</td>
    </tr>
</table>

::: notes

**Observations** need to be transformed into visual **marks**.

Data Density: An overall characteristic of the visual elements, used in combination, is data density. Data density refers to the number of useful data points you can get into an area.

We can only represent as many marks (as representations of observations) as we have pixels: in a picture of 1000 x 1000 pixels, the maximum of observations to fit is 1 million. How big is that?

More than 1 pixel is used to represent each data point, + complimentary pixels for titles, labels, white space.

Reduction is required.

Some strategies to overcome this constraint:

>1. Filter observations
>2. Split data into multiple charts
>3. Augmented visualizations
>4. Densify

::: notes

Not only that so much data can be displayed, but that it cannot actually be correctly interpreted.

1, 2, 3 and 5, escape densification; 4 represents density.

<!-- ![Example of small multiples: The Trilogy Meter (Meth 2009)](img/smallmultiples2.jpg){height="300"} -->

::: notes

Small multiples are sets of charts of the same type, with the same scale, presented together at a small size and with minimal detail, usually in a grid of some kind (in this case grid irrelevant). The term was at least popularized by Edward Tufte, appearing first in his seminal book _Visual Display of Quantitative Information_ in 1983. He says of them:

>Small multiples are economical: once viewers understand the design of one [chart], they have immediate access to the data in all the other [charts]… as the eye moves from one [chart] to the next, the consistency of the design allows viewers to focus on changes in the data rather than on changes in graphical design.

These will show up again later.

Dense clusters of lines are easy to spot in blue, while bright yellow shows areas with few stock price lines. The drop that came with the financial crisis in 2008 is clearly visible. Similarly, we can see two dense bands of stock values around $15 and $25, showing that companies (or customers) tend toward round stock prices.

This is similar to what happens with marathon finishing times, what is called "Reference-Dependent Preferences" that model behaviour towards arbitrary references for no evident reasons other than the reference itself.

>We provide visual and statistical evidence that round numbers (e.g., a four-hour marathon) serve as reference points in this environment and as a result produce significant bunching of performance at these round numbers. Bunching is driven by planning and adjustments in effort provision near the finish line and cannot be explained by explicit rewards (e.g., qualifying for the Boston Marathon), peer effects, or institutional features (e.g., pacesetters).

::: notes

- A static visualization that uses the data that is available when the visualization is created. Any new data requires a refresh.
- From Windows Task Manager: `Ctrl+Shift+Esc`
    - A real-time visualization that looks like the static one but updates itself constantly.
    - A streaming data visualization that shows the flow of data and the impact it has on the statistics.

Perception of moving elements poses an additional difficulty for interpretation.

- **Null** &nbsp; Absence of measurement
- **Zero** &nbsp; Absence of amount/magnitude  
- **Blank** &nbsp; Try to use _nothing_ to represent _something_


::: notes

`zero` can be represented by 

- position + axis
- area + axis
- color shading
- density
- angle? we can't see 0º
- area only? we can't see

the last two require an alternative (like annotation)

`blank` gives us space to breath. Requires courage, implies losing the potential to densify, add advertising.

![Visual channels control the appearance of marks (Munzner 2014, p.96)](img/munzner-5.3.png){width="400"}

::: notes

Channels represent information about the marks (variables), qualitites. 

Don't take up space, BUT there are only so many channels we can use in a visual representation.

One and only one attribute/variable should be used per channel. Multiple channels per attribute are possible (redundant encoding).

All channels are not equal: the selection of marks and channels should be guided by the principles of expressivenes and effectiveness. i.e. if communicating magnitude, no sense in using size to represent anything else.

It is required to reduce dimensionality (statistically): PCA, factors, clustering.

::: notes

Graphic variables than can be used are limited, a reduction is required. 

Once the most important attributes/variables for the desired insight have been identified, the selection of marks and channels should ensure that they are encoded with the highest ranked.

The choice of which attributes/variables to encode with position is the most central choice in visual encoding.

The combination of these elements of visual language has generated commonly used ways, or idioms, to represent certain types of data (i.e. line graphs for time-dependent unique variables).

These artefacts, or products, we are making to be told to others, or communicated. We will now see the implications of this social action applied to data visualization through a series of articles published by Elijah Meeks: Data visualization Engineer at Apple, formerly Netflix.

Even if this section shows the most communicative-social science view, he is actually an engineer and wrote a book about D3js. He is advocating this communicative view into the more "this is an engineering problem" take. 

He sees a great problem in current data visualization.

:::


### <span class="pretitle">2. Data visualization as a communication product</span> What charts say {data-transition="slide-in fade-out"}

**Explicitly**

Charts _do_ "show me the data" (actually, it's more that they **tell** the data than actually show it).

Means choosing the right specific chart to use in order to display and query the data.

. . .

**How to improve:** Expose data cleanly and clearly. Aim for either query or validation. Distinguish accuracy _vs._ precision.

::: notes

Accuracy refers to the closeness of a measured value to a standard or known value. For example, if in lab you obtain a weight measurement of 3.2 kg for a given substance, but the actual or known weight is 10 kg, then your measurement is not accurate. In this case, your measurement is not close to the known value.

Precision refers to the closeness of two or more measurements to each other. Using the example above, if you weigh a given substance five times, and get 3.2 kg each time, then your measurement is very precise. Precision is independent of accuracy. You can be very precise but inaccurate, as described above. You can also be accurate but imprecise.

For example, if on average, your measurements for a given substance are close to the known value, but the measurements are far from each other, then you have accuracy without precision.

### <span class="pretitle">2. Data visualization as a communication product</span> What charts say {data-transition="fade"}

No chart is an unbiased view of the data, as data visualization is a manufactured artefact.

::: notes

This chart would be an example of "not designing" or using the usual ways of doing dataviz. However this is actually a remake of this original chart:

Carries a very strong message. Red, bars point down, looks like blood. Very evocative, emphasized by the title.

There is deliberate choice in:

- Rotation: There's still a peak, but the decline is more apparent
- Title: To match the main takeaway of the graph
- Color: not like blood anymore
- "Situation in Iraq is improving" --> Completely different message!

Neither of those charts is lying. The opinionated nature of charts should be acknowledged and embraced.

### <span class="pretitle">2. Data visualization as a communication product</span> What charts say {data-transition="fade"}

**Implicitly**

The implicit channel of a data visualization (the title and other framing elements) can be even more powerful than the explicit channel.

Enable removing and adjusting data visualization elements to reduce complexity, not based on screen size as in responsive data visualization, but on priority.

A chart that’s being integrated into another display or presentation can find itself in front of an audience that does not have the same domain knowledge as the primary audience, so this is yet another reason to have its data sources, dimensions and metrics more explicitly described.

::: notes

Data visualization is a communication product. 

There is no such thing as raw data, and there is neither such a thing as a raw data visualization (aseptic, unbiased view on the data). Even if we understood datavis as a photograph of the data, photos are long taken as political products, with a meaning, and one view of reality and not another one. But what's more, I wouldn't even say that datavis are photos of the data, they are more illustrations, drawings of the data, more crafted than photographs. And as such, we should draw them with purpose, and we should draw them FOR the user/the reader, meaning we should make them adapted, and responsive.
